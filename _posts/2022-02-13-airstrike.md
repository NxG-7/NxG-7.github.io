Airstrike is a tool that utilizes client-server architecture to automate the process of cracking WPA-2 Wi-Fi credentials.

Requirements
--

The Hashcat Brain Architecture, along with the `aircrack-ng` suite, `entr` utility, and various helper scripts, are utilized by Airstrike.

The `install.s`h script can be utilized to acquire all dependencies. However, if you're on a Gentoo system, you'll have to manually install hcxtools since they're not accessible in their repositories, unless I missed something. Additionally, some lesser-known distros like Alpine do not include the hashcat package, but Nix can be used on those distros. All the required packages are available in nixpkgs.

To enter Nix-Shell with the required dependencies when using Nix/NixOS, you can use the following command:

```bash
nix-shell -p hashcat hashcat-utils aircrack-ng entr hcxtools
```

Usage
--

To crack passwords, execute the `aircrack_server.sh` script on the specific machine. The `aircrack_client.sh` file generated by this script can run on any Linux host that is capable of connecting to the previously launched server. Once executed, the client automatically captures handshakes, establishes a connection with the server, and transmits the captured data.

The `watcher.sh` script prints out the password to the server terminal when it is successfully cracked by the server.

To use `airstrike_client.sh`, the only mandatory option flag is `-w`, which specifies the wordlist that the server should use. You can also specify the listening interface by using the `-i` flag, although if not specified, the current wireless interface will be selected automatically as the default.

Moreover, `airstrike_client.sh` is designed to intercept WPA-2 data indiscriminately, which implies that it has the ability to seize and decrypt passwords for all Wi-Fi networks within its range (whenever handshakes occur).

Navigation
--

`Ctrl + S` will send capturd assets (Wi-Fi hansdhakes in `.hccapx` form) to the server. `Ctrl + I` disaplays information about capture progress.

Above shortcuts can be used inside a running instance of `airstrike_client.sh`
