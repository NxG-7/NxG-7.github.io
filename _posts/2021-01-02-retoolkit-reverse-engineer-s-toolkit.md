If you're keen on reverse engineering and/or analyzing malware on x86 and x64 Windows systems, this assortment of tools might be of interest to you. Upon installation of this toolkit, a folder containing shortcuts to RE tools like these will appear on your desktop.

Why do I need it?
--

One option is to download the tools from their website and install them yourself on a new VM. However, by using retoolkit, you may save time since the tools come pre-configured with features such as x64dbg with plugins and command-line tools that can be accessed from any directory. This may be particularly useful if you're in the process of setting up a new analysis VM.
