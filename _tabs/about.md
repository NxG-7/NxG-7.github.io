Through technical articles and practical tips, I aim to educate individuals on the latest `cybersecurity` trends, best practices, and technologies to stay safe and secure online. My blog covers a wide range of topics, including `red teaming`, `threat intelligence`, `open source intelligence`, `ctf challenges` & `ethical hacking tools and frameworks`.
